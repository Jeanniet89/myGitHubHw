            <p id="par"><h2><strong>Dwayne Douglas Johnson</strong></h2> <br/> <em>(born May 2, 1972)<em> <br/> Known by his ring name The Rock, is an American-Canadian actor, producer, businessman, retired professional wrestler, former American football player, AND ONE DAY MY HUSBAND.
              He wrestled for the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE) for eight years prior to pursuing an acting career. His films have grossed over $3.5 billion in North America and over $10.5 billion worldwide, making him one of the highest-grossing actors of all time.
              Johnson was a college football player for the University of Miami, with whom he won a national championship in 1991. He initially aspired for a professional career in football and entered the 1995 NFL Draft, but went undrafted.
            </p>
            <p id="par1"><h2>As a result...</h2> <br/>
              Johnson signed with the Calgary Stampeders of the Canadian Football League (CFL), but was cut from the team in the middle of his first season. Shortly after, he began training as a professional wrestler.
              In 1996, Johnson secured a contract with the WWF and was promoted as the first third-generation wrestler in the company's history, as he is the son of Rocky Johnson and grandson of Peter Maivia.
              He rose to prominence after developing a charismatic persona of a boastful, trash-talking wrestler named The Rock.
              He subsequently won his first WWF Championship in 1998 and helped usher the WWF into the "Attitude Era", a boom period in the company's business in the late 1990s and early 2000s which still holds professional wrestling records for television ratings.
            </p>
            <p id="par2"><h2>Then in 2004...</h2> <br/>
              Johnson left the WWE to pursue an acting career. He returned in 2011 as a part-time performer until 2013, and made sporadic appearances from then until fully retiring in 2019.
              Considered one of the greatest professional wrestlers and biggest wrestling draws of all time, Johnson headlined the most-bought professional wrestling pay-per-view event ever (WrestleMania XXVIII)
              and was featured among the most watched episodes of WWE's two flagship television shows (Raw and SmackDown). He has won several championships, being a two-time Intercontinental Champion, a five-time tag team champion, and a 10-time world champion.
              He was also a Royal Rumble match winner and WWE's sixth Triple Crown champion.
